# Assignment2
Let us discuss the over all assignment in continuous steps

1.Data Loading: Start by loading the dataset into your environment. You can use pandas to read the CSV file containing your data.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. This involves:
Checking the first few rows of the dataset using head() to understand the features and data format.
Checking for missing values using isnull() and handling them appropriately.
Visualizing distributions of features using histograms, box plots, or density plots.
Exploring relationships between features and the target variable using scatter plots, correlation matrices, or pair plots.

3.Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for modeling by performing preprocessing tasks such as:
Encoding categorical variables like "Load_Type" using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scaling numerical features to ensure they are on similar scales using techniques like Min-Max scaling or Standard scaling.
Handling missing values by imputation or removal based on the nature of the data.

4.Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing features to extract more information from the dataset. This could involve:
Extracting temporal features from the "Date" column, such as month, day, or hour.
Creating interaction features by combining existing features.
Performing dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA if necessary.

5.Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models for classification. Some common models for classification tasks include:
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
Neural Networks (if applicable)

6.Model Training: Train multiple models using the training dataset. Split your dataset into training and validation sets using techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness.

7.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score. Choose the model with the best performance as your final model.

8.Validation and Testing: Implement a validation strategy using the last month of data as the test set to assess the model's performance. Evaluate the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data using the chosen evaluation metrics.

9.Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of your selected model to optimize its performance. Use techniques like grid search or randomized search to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

10.Final Model Deployment: Once you're satisfied with the performance of your model, deploy it for real-world predictions. Monitor its performance over time and retrain as necessary.

By following these steps, you can develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the load type of a power system based on historical data. Remember to document your process and results thoroughly for future reference and reproducibility.

This assignment I have done to my level best so I just expirimented each model approach to get accurately predicting model.
